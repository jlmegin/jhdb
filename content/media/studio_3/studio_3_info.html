      February 8, 1994</p>
      <p>On January 3, 1994, an exciting, new show premiered on WGMC-TV3.</p>
      <p>&quot;Studio 3&quot; is a half-hour music and interview program featuring the best 
        jazz groups in New England.  The show airs Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
        Thursdays at 10:30pm, following the news.</p>
      <p>Taped before a live audience on Monday nights at Greater Media, &quot;Studio 3&quot; 
        is produced and hosted by &quot;Newswatch 3&quot; Arts &amp; Entertainment reporter, Toni 
        Ballard.   Directing the four-camera shoot is Doug Frauenholz, who does the 
        post-production editing and also designed all of the graphics for the show. 
        Jack Wertheimer, of WICN-FM and Brownstone Recordings and producer of the&quot;Jazz at Sunset&quot; concert series at the New England Science Center, was 
        brought in as co-producer and talent coordinator.  Other contributors have 
        been Blair Cole, lighting, and on cameras, Jim Burke, Paul Racette, John 
        Bazouksas, Chris Byork, Tim Young, Bob McElroy and John Suire.</p>
      <p>&quot;Studio 3&quot; was conceived out of a desire to bring jazz to an enthusiastic, 
        ever growing audience in the community  and to give the kind of exposure 
        that only television can provide to the many excellent jazz musicians in New 
        England.  A jazz vocalist herself, and a former jazz radio host, Toni 
        Ballard had been exploring the idea of doing an &quot;on-location&quot; jazz program 
        for several months.  It was Allan Eisenberg who came up with the idea to 
        tape the show right in the studio at Greater Media.  The biggest obstacle 
        was the sound.  Realizing that we lacked the equipment needed to record 
        music, Toni approached Immedia Sound to see if they would be willing to 
        trade sound engineering services and equipment for commercial time and a 
        produced spot.  Immedia agreed to the trade.</p>
      <p>While &quot;Studio 3&quot; was still in the planning stages, Allan was approached by 
        local singer Jim Porcella who was planning a live CD recording with the Jeff 
        Holmes Big Band at the El Morocco Restaurant.  Allan decided to send the 
        mobile studio, with Doug directing, to videotape one evening of the 
        two-night recording session.  Two complete shows were produced from that 
        evening's performance.</p>
      <p>Other programs include Dick Odgren and Emil Haddad; the Rich Falco Quartet; 
        the Dixieland group, Made in the Shade; guitarist Jane Miller; the Sled 
        Dogs; pianist Mark Kross with jazz legend Herb Pomeroy.  On February 25th, 
        the crew will do another &quot;on-location&quot; taping with vibraphonist Cecilia 
        Smith at WPI.  Plans are also in the works to tape shows in Boston and at 
        the &quot;Jazz at Sunset&quot; series and to syndicate the program to other cable 
        systems.</p></td>

    <td colspan="3"><p>Studio 3, which premiered January 3, 1994, is a half-hour program of music
      and interviews featuring the best jazz and improvisational groups in New
      England, as well as some internationally-known acts, performing at Mechanics
      Hall and other venues in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Hosted and produced by
      Toni Ballard, the show airs three nights a week on WGMC-TV3 and is seen in
      twenty towns in Worcester County.  The Worcester Magazine Readers' Poll
      proclaimed Studio 3 the best local program.  The show was one of five music
      programs in the country nominated for a local CableACE'93 award.  And in
      1997, the New England Chapter of Women in Cable and Telecommunications
      awarded Studio 3 the title of best cable program in New England produced by
      a woman.</p>
      <p>Studio 3 was conceived out of a desire to bring jazz to an enthusiastic,
        ever growing audience in the community and to give the kind of exposure that
        only television can provide to the many excellent jazz musicians in New
        England.  During its first two seasons, Studio 3 was taped live-to-switcher
        with four cameras before a live audience, primarily at the studio of
        WGMC-TV3.  Since the fall of 1995, all shows have been taped on location:
        at concerts featuring jazz greats like guitarist Larry Coryell, pianist
        James Williams and Intensive Care Unit, and vibraphonist Warren Chiasson at
        beautiful Mechanics Hall; at jazz venues like El Morocco and Sakura Tokyo;
        and at the Jazz at Sunset concert series at the EcoTarium, formerly the New
        England Science Center.  Critical to the show's success has been the
        promotion of upcoming telecasts by jazz hosts on WICN-90.5FM, National
        Public Radio in Worcester.</p>
      <p>Among the groups featured on 96 eclectic shows taped over the past seven
        years are vibraphonist Cecilia Smith; pianist Dick Odgren and trumpeter Emil
        Haddad; jazz singers Shawnn Monteiro, Karrin Allyson, Dave Frishberg, Jim
        Porcella, Steve Marvin, Luciana Souza, Donna Byrne, Monica Hatch, Linda
        Dagnello, and Lisa Thorson; guitarist Jane Miller; clarinetist Harry Skoler
        with cornetist Warren Vache; trumpeters Herb Pomeroy and Lou Colombo; the
        acapella group, Vox One and the solo voice of Bob Stoloff;  the American
        television debut of South African vocalist Tsidii LeLoka, who was recently
        nominated for a Tony Award for her featured performance on Broadway in The
        Lion King; the world music group Unu Mondo; German bassist Fabian Bausch; saxophonists Dick Johnson, Billy Novick and Cercie Miller; the cabaret of
        Lynne Jackson and Mike Palter and Carol O'Shaughnessey; the jazz/rock/blues 
        of the Sled Dogs; the country/swing of Valerie and Walter Crockett; as well 
        as the Silver Leaf Gospel Singers, the Tuxedo Classic Jazz Band, and the 
        Silver Bullet Swing Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Historically, it's been difficult for jazz groups to attract large audiences 
        in the Worcester clubs.  The economy of the early '90's resulted in fewer 
        people going outside their homes for entertainment, especially in the colder 
        months.  We believed that providing a quality jazz program would address 
        this issue and, at the same time, expose people to music they might not hear 
        otherwise.  From the musicians' perspective, this could only mean a bigger 
        audience for subsequent live performances and an increase in their CD sales.</p>
      <p>We believe that Studio 3 is much more than entertainment.  Not only is our 
        program a recording of a musical event; it's a vehicle for Worcester County 
        residents to celebrate artistic excellence in their community.  Studio 3 
        also gives WGMC-TV3 the opportunity to play an active role in the movement 
        to keep jazz -- one of the few truly American art forms -- alive.</p></td>
