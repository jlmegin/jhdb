      <description>Since its inception in 1988, the "trio" has expanded to include international performer and recording artist, Billy Novick on alto sax and clarinet; and on trumpet and flugelhorn, jazz legend Herb Pomeroy, a long-time Berklee professor who's performed and/or recorded with Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Stan Kenton, John Lewis, and Paul Gonsalves, to name a few. Pianist/composer Mark Kross and his group of stellar players can best be described as acoustic post-bop.</description>
