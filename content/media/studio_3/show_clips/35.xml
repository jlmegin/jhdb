      <description>This one-of-a-kind Studio 3 showcases the amazing vocal impressionism of Bob Stoloff. Associate professor at Berklee College, Bob worked in the early '80's with Bobby McFerrin in the a cappella group Jazz Vocal Summit and later formed the Berklee Vocal Summit, which has spawned many talented singers -- including Vox One. Bob's eclectic repertoire runs from Duke Ellington to Herbie Hancock to Mick Jagger.</description>
