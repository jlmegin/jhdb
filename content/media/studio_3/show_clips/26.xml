      <description>Jim Heffernan on piano and Jerry Sabatini on trumpet and flugelhorn are complemented by bassist Bob Simonelli, making his fourth appearance on Studio 3, and Eric Nebbia, who was a member of the Marian McPartland Trio for three years. Their music, infused with African, Afro-Cuban and salsa rhythms, makes for a very high energy, entertaining show.</description>
